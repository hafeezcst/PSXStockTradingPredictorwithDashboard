- Supports both REST and WebSocket connections for real-time data

#### 1.2 Data Fetcher
- Orchestrates the data collection process
- Implements multi-threading for parallel data retrieval
- Manages request rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- Handles incremental data updates

### 2. Data Storage Layer

#### 2.1 Database Manager
- Manages SQLite database connections with failover support
- Implements connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Handles database migrations and schema updates
- Provides transaction management and atomic operations

#### 2.2 Data Models
- Symbol data model
- Historical price data model
- Technical indicator data model
- Prediction result data model
- Market breadth data model

### 3. Processing Layer

#### 3.1 Data Preprocessor
- Cleans and normalizes raw market data
- Handles missing data points through interpolation
- Performs feature engineering for ML models
- Implements data validation and integrity checks

#### 3.2 Technical Analysis Engine
- Calculates standard technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Identifies chart patterns and support/resistance levels
- Generates trading signals based on indicator combinations
- Calculates market breadth metrics

### 4. Machine Learning Layer

#### 4.1 Model Manager
- Handles model training, validation, and deployment
- Implements model versioning and experiment tracking
- Manages feature selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Supports multiple model types (LSTM, Random Forest, etc.)

#### 4.2 Prediction Engine
- Generates price forecasts using trained models
- Calculates prediction confidence intervals
- Evaluates prediction accuracy using RMSE and RÂ²
- Identifies top bullish and bearish stocks

### 5. Presentation Layer

#### 5.1 Visualization Engine
- Generates technical analysis charts
- Creates prediction visualization charts
- Supports interactive data exploration
- Produces performance reports and dashboards

#### 5.2 Notification System
- Sends alerts via Telegram
- Generates daily/weekly summary reports
- Delivers actionable trading signals
- Provides system status notifications

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition Flow**:
   - The Data Fetcher initiates data collection based on configured schedules
   - PSX API Client retrieves data from external sources
   - Raw data is validated and passed to the Data Preprocessor
   - Processed data is stored in the database via Database Manager

2. **Analysis Flow**:
   - Technical Analysis Engine retrieves data from the database
   - Indicators and signals are calculated and stored back in the database
   - Market breadth metrics are updated

3. **Prediction Flow**:
   - Model Manager retrieves historical data and features
   - Prediction Engine generates forecasts using trained models
   - Results are stored in the database and visualized
   - Top picks are identified and notifications are sent

## Technical Implementation

### Threading Model

The system employs a dynamic thread management approach:
- Core thread pool for database operations
- Separate thread pool for API requests with configurable limits
- Worker threads for CPU-intensive calculations
- Thread synchronization using locks and semaphores

### Error Handling Strategy

- Hierarchical error classification system
- Retry mechanisms with configurable parameters
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Comprehensive logging with contextual information
- Automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios

### Configuration Management

- Centralized configuration via config.ini
- Environment-specific overrides
- Runtime configuration updates
- Secure storage for sensitive configuration values

### Performance Optimization

- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Connection pooling for database access
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Asynchronous I/O for network operations

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development with SQLite database
- Unit tests with pytest
- Code quality checks with flake8 and mypy

### Production Environment
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Scheduled execution via cron jobs
- Persistent storage volumes for databases
- Logging to centralized log management system

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Automated backup procedures
- Alerting for system failures
- Usage statistics and analytics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scalability Improvements**:
   - Migration to a distributed architecture
   - Implementation of message queues for asynchronous processing
   - Support for horizontal scaling of processing components

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Integration of sentiment analysis from news and social media
   - Implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms
   - Development of custom trading strategies

3. **User Interface**:
   - Web-based dashboard for system monitoring
   - Interactive visualization tools
   - User-configurable alerts and notifications
